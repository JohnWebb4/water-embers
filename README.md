## Heading ##
  > Water Heater Interface

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Enthusiasts / DIY that want to search their water heater status over time

## Summary ##
  > Water heater temperatures fluxuate throughout the day and with the season.
  > Know when is a good time to take a shower
  > Identify blockages in your piping system
  > Look at the efficiency of your heating fluid as it goes from heat source to home

## Problem ##
  > Water heaters (especially solar water heaters) fluxuate in temperature
  > Identifying bottlenecks in your heating can be time consuming with little results

## Solution ##
  > Know the temperature at each time of the day and throughout the year allows you to identify fluxuations
  > Don't search for bottleneck, know where in your piping the temperature is dropping and the bottleneck is
  > Get real-time results as you test the efficiency of your system

## Quote from You ##
  > "Saves hours of searching for bottlenecks, and ensures you actually find the problem"
